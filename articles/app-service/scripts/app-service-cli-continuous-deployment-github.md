# Create a web app with continuous deployment from GitHub using CLI

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. For GitHub deployment without continuous deployment, see [Create a web app and deploy code from GitHub](app-service-cli-deploy-github.md). For this sample, you need:

* A GitHub repository with application code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) for your GitHub account.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
